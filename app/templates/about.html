        <p class="h2">Hello! My name is Danny Pernik. I've had the privilege of working with
          hundreds of students over the past 5 years to help them substantially
          increase grades and test scores, strengthen confidence in and out of the
          classroom, and get accepted into some of the most selective and
          prestigious universities in the country.
        </p>

        <p class="h2">I love to tutor. I really enjoy getting to connect one-on-one with
          students as a peer rather than as an authority figure. Prior to Open
          Path Tutoring, I worked for two of the leading test prep companies in
          the country. I gained valuable perspective regarding not only the
          variety of test prep strategies but also the subtle art of building
          trust and rapport with high schoolers. Students tend to be more receptive
          to ideas or feedback when I share them than when a parent or teacher
          shares them. I feel fortunate to be given the opportunity to connect
          meaningfully with so many fantastic teenagers.
        </p>

        <p class="h2">I love to spend time with my family, explore and support ideas to
          change the world, play soccer, and grow my spiritual connection.
          Online tutoring has allowed me to spend more time with my son Ember
          and daughter Zeta as they grow up. It brings challenges too, of course,
          but I will gladly accept. The kids are a long way from college, but when
          they start test prep, I will find them a tutor too. I know better than
          to expect them to listen to me!
        </p>

        <p class="h2">Open Path Tutoring is the third entrepreneurial journey I've
          embarked upon since 2011. I love to explore ideas that forge new
          connections within communities and make the world a better place.
          I previously cofounded an organization called openCurrents that
          aimed to provide a living wage to volunteers of nonprofits through
          digital currency. Nonprofits issued 1 "Current" to volunteers for
          each hour worked, and businesses in the community gave discounts
          to volunteers in exchange for Currents. While our pilot program
          got off to a promising start, all three cofounders became fathers
          within the first year of operations, and family responsibilities
          ultimately took priority.
