    <p>
      Hi {{ user.parent_name.title() }},
      {% if relation == 'parent' %}
        thank you for requesting a practice
        {% if test == 'test' %}
          SAT or ACT.
        {% else %}
          {{ test }}. The test can be downloaded at the link below.
        {% endif %}
      {% else %}
        we received a request from {{ student }} for a practice
        {% if test == 'test' %}SAT or ACT{% else %}{{ test }} (linked below){% endif %}
        and wanted to ask your permission to follow up with your student regarding
        test results and score analysis.
      {% endif %}
    </p>

    {% if test == 'test' %}
      <p>
        Several factors influence which test will be a better fit, so it will be helpful
        to learn more about {{ student }}'s strengths and learning style.
        Would you have time for a brief phone call over the next few days?
        {{ student }} is welcome to join too!

        {{ student }}, here are your next steps on the path to a great score:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Print the test and included scantron sheet.</strong>
          By completing the test on paper instead of the computer, the practice test
          will more closely resemble the real thing, making preparation more useful.
          Speaking of which...
        </li>
        <li><strong>Take the test in one sitting if possible.</strong> It's okay if you need
          to split it up, though.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Time yourself.</strong> Be sure to stop work on each section when
          time is up. (You're welcome to try the remaining problems, but make note of
          which questions you answered after time expired.)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Get in touch.</strong> Reply to this email before taking the test
          if you need clarification or afterwards to get your score assessment.
        </li>
      </ul>
